# Face-Mask-Detection
Global pandemic COVID-19 circumstances emerged in an epidemic of dangerous disease in all over the world. The pandemic has made face masks a necessary accessory in daily life to prevent the spread of the virus. In this project, I developed a face mask detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a Haarcascade classifier.The project involves training the CNN model on a dataset of images of people wearing and not wearing masks, and then using the Haarcascade classifier to detect faces in real-time video streams. The CNN model was used to predict whether a person was wearing a mask or not, and the Haarcascade classifier was used to locate the face region. The system achieved high accuracy in detecting whether a person was wearing a mask or not, making it a useful tool in helping to ensure compliance with mask-wearing mandates.
